A copy of the file with your changes is saved in a temporary location as shown above.

You can then delete the existing pod by running the command:

kubectl delete pod webapp

Then create a new pod with your changes using the temporary file:

kubectl create -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-ccvrq.yaml

2. The second option is to extract the pod definition in YAML format to a file using the command

kubectl get pod webapp -o yaml > my-new-pod.yaml

Then make the changes to the exported file using an editor (vi editor). Save the changes

vi my-new-pod.yaml

Then delete the existing pod

kubectl delete pod webapp

Then create a new pod with the edited file

kubectl create -f my-new-pod.yaml

Edit Deployments
With Deployments you can easily edit any field/property of the POD template. Since the pod template is a child of the deployment specification, with every change the deployment will automatically delete and create a new pod with the new changes. So if you are asked to edit a property of a POD part of a deployment you may do that simply by running the command

kubectl edit deployment my-deployment
